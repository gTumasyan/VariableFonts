Welcome to my variable fonts project! This repository contains the results of my experimentation with this exciting new technology. I was intrigued by the idea of fonts that can change their weight, width, and other attributes in a smooth and continuous way, and I wanted to see what kind of typography I could create using these fonts.

I spent several weeks exploring the capabilities of these fonts and experimenting with different designs. I was amazed by the flexibility and expressiveness of the variable fonts, and I found that I could create designs that were simply not possible with traditional static fonts.

In the end, I produced some stunning typography that I'm really proud of. You can see the results for yourself [ https://variable-fonts.vercel.app/ / by following this link / by downloading the project and running it locally]. I hope that my work inspires you to explore the possibilities of variable fonts and experiment with them in your own designs.

If you have any questions or feedback, please don't hesitate to reach out. I'd love to hear from you!
